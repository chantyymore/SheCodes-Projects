                <em>Why i love fiction books?</em>
                <br />Fiction gives an escape from reality. When  i am tired or have had a long day,
                reading a fiction book just helps me relax and forget about everything else. Reading it
                is a great way to distress and boost your mood while improving your vocabulary at the same time.
